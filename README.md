# Bikesharing Project for Des Moine, Iowa
##### Visualizing Citibike data using Tableau.
### Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze Citibike data use in New York City to understand rideship trends and patterns in order to determine if such mode of public transportation can be successfully be launched in Des Moine, Iowa.

### Results
In order to understand the pattern of Citibike use in New York City, the following tables were generated to visually analyze the data provided by [Citibike NYC](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data):

* Bike Users By Trip Length (figure. 1)

* Bike Use By Trip Length & Gender (figure. 2)

* Weekday Use By Hour (figure. 3)

* Weekday Use By Hour & Gender (figure. 4)

* User Type By Gender & Weekday (figure. 5)

* Top Starting Locations (figure. 6)

* Top Ending Locations (figure. 7)

#### Within the first hour of the ride, most rides (just under 150,000) are under 20 minutes long. The use of bikes dramatically decreases as the duration of the ride extends towards 1 hour. Few riders are using the bike for longer than 1 hour.

#### Just under 110,000 riders are self reported male. Followed by about 35,000 riders are self reported female. The remaining approximate 8,000 riders did not identify their gender.

#### During the weekday, between 7-9am (morning rush hour) and 5-7pm (evening rush hour) is when bike use is at its highest. Out of the weekdays, Thursday has the highest bike use in those respective time slots.

#### Majority of the riders throughout the week are males with a subscription, followed by female riders who are subscribers, and unknown riders are the least. There are more subscribed riders than one time use riders using Citibikes across all gender groups.

### Summary
In summary, morning (7am-9am) rush hour and evening (5-7pm) rush hour appears to be the time when CitiBikes are used the most. Majority of the riders are male and hold a subscription. The rides are generally within an hour long and the trip ends within the same area as its origin (midtown and west side of Manhattan). This is indicative that the bikes are used to commute to short distance destinations in areas that not only have alot of tourist attractions, but office buildings where commuters using the bikes potentially work at. These are important ridership factors and traits to consider when launching a similar bike share program in Des Moine, Iowa. Particularly if the tourist population is considerably less compared to New York City and the target population are commuters.

Additional analysis to consider in order to get a better idea on ridership characteristics are:
* User type and trip duration - to get a better idea what kind of trips subscribers take compared to one time use customers.
* End Station Names with Top Ending Locations - To get a clearer understanding on the specific locations that are popular final destinations for riders.
